# Fenugreek
In telugu it is also known as menthulu.

# Tips
Try to keep fenugreek seeds soaked in water over night.

# Procedure
- Make sure your pot has hole at the bottom, so water can come out. This will help plants from not getting rotten.
- Fill the pot with proper potting soil mixture. Do not fill upto the brim. Leave upto about 3 inches from the top.
- Put the fenugreek seeds. You can also make lines in the soil and then place those seeds so the plants will grow in a line.
- Now cover those seeds loosly with soil for about 1/2 - 1 inch.
- Rather than draining completely with water, try to sprinkle it.
